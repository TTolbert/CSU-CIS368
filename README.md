CIS-368: MyUtility.java
===========

This is my second of three assignments in my Object Oriented Programming course at Cleveland State University, in my senior year of high school. It applies the concepts of reflection and recursion in a graphical user interface.

There are 5 functions for use in this interface:
1. Display Array Contents: Displays the content of a multi-dimensional array
2. Clone an Array: Recursively clones a multi-dimensional array of Objects
3. Modify an Array: Replaces a portion of one array with another
4. Invoke Instance Method: Invokes instance method specified on any instance stored in the hashmap
5. View non-array Instance: Views instances stored on the hashmap

This is code from about a year and a half after beginning to learn programming, and possibly one of my favorite projects.
